**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**:

The most interesting topic covered in my domain thus far are the different techniques used to enhance the accuracy of search results.
I didn't realize how many different ways there were to refine search results, such as boosting on certain fields, using Learning to Rank
to rerank initial search results, etc.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One potential investigation that I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is implementing a practical search application
that uses the techniques we've learned this quarter. The section mentor has mentioned creating a search engine that users can use
to look up all capstone projects ever produced at UCSD, which sounds like an interesting project to do. This would require searching
over the GitHub repositories of all UCSD DSC capstone projects ever created and building a search engine that can search through
code well.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make is to focus more on the user interaction with the search engine. In the current Quarter 1 Project,
I've mainly been focusing on ways to improve the accuracy of the search engine, rather than the actual use of the search engine.
In the Quarter 2 Project, since I'm hoping to actually implement a search application for users to use, I think it would be important
to consider factors such as ranking more recent documents higher, ranking scarcer items higher than a low inventory item 
(mainly an e-commerce concept), personalizing search, and considering the user interface.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

For the Quarter 2 Project, I would want to branch out and use newer, possibly more moden, techniques compared to the ones we've used
in our assigned tasks in Quarter 1. This includes potentially using graphs, trying to use search engine libraries such as Lucene, 
or using methods that speed up search such as ANNoy or FAISS.
